# Anatex
Anatex is an application developed during my graduation for the course "Data Structures II". Its made in C ++ and uses a trie tree and queue to interpret input text and mark relevant terms with hyperlinks to its corresponding wikipedia page

I think this was a great project in my learning, despite having made many mistakes at the time.
Most of the comments in the code are in Portuguese, unfortunately 😞
